# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple game built using Python's tkinter library. Let's dive into how you can play and contribute to the project.

## Introduction

This project is a simple Number Guessing Game built using Python's tkinter library. It allows players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the target number. Players can track their attempts, and a high score is displayed at the end of each round. Players have the option to play again or exit the game based on their preference.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the game by executing the script `number_guessing_game.py`.
4. A tkinter window will open, prompting you to enter your name and start the game.
5. Enter your name in the provided entry box and click the "Start Game" button.
6. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10.
7. Enter your guesses in the input box and press Enter to submit your guess.
8. The game will provide feedback if your guess is higher or lower than the target number.
9. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
