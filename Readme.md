
Number Guessing Game

Introduction:
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game built using Python's tkinter library. It allows players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the target number. Players can track their attempts, and a high score is displayed at the end of each round. Players have the option to play again or exit the game based on their preference.

The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10.
Enter your guesses in the input box and press Enter to submit your guess.
The game will provide feedback if your guess is higher or lower than the target number.
